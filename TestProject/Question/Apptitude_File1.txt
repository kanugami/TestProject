a)	76 meters.
b)	89 meters.
c)	71 meters.
d)	84 meters.
Answer: A 76 Meters
Explanation:
	Let's assume A finishes the 600 m race in 60 sec, then
	600/60 = 10 m/sec is his speed
	B traveled (600-60 = 540 m in 60 sec, therefore
	540/60 = 9 m/sec is B's speed : "in a race of 500 metres, B can beat C by 50 metres."
	500/9 = 55.56 sec is B's time to finish a 500 m race
	C traveled 500-50 = 450 m in 55.56 sec, therefore
	450/55.56 = 8.1 m/sec is C's speed: By how many will A beat C in a race of 400 metres?
	400/10 = 40 sec for A to run a 400 m race

Answer: A 1000
Explanation:
Give the yearly portion a chance to be Rs.100. The principal portion will be paid one year from now i.e. 3 years before it is in reality due. The second portion will be paid a long time from now i.e. 2 years before it is in reality due.
The third portion will be paid 1 year before it is in reality due.
The fourth portion will be paid on the day the sum is in reality due.
On the main portion, the intrigue will be paid for a long time, on the second for a long time, on the third for 1 year, on the fourth for multi-year. Altogether an enthusiasm for a long time will be paid (3 + 2 + 1 + 0) on Rs. 100 @ 10%. Intrigue = (100 × 6 × 10)/100 = Rs. 60 and the essential is Rs 100 × 4 = Rs 400. The aggregate credit that can be released is Rs. 400 + 60 = Rs. 460. Here the system of Chain Rule will be connected. I.e. for Rs. 460 the portion required is Rs. 100, for Rs. 4600 the portion required is 4600 × 100/460 = Rs. 1000.

	Suppose speed of second train b=x m/s.
	Train are moving in opposite direction, hence their speed = (10+x) m/sec <relative>
	therefore total distance to be covered = (150+150) = 300
	time=5 secs
	hence,
	Speed = distance/time
	10+x= 300/5
	X= 50m/sec
