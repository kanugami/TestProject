Answer: c
Explanation: SQL does not include total as a built in aggregate function. The avg is used to find average, max is used to find the maximum and the count is used to count the number of values.
2. Observe the given SQL query and choose the correct option.

b) The query is syntactically wrong
c) The query is syntactically correct and gives the correct answer
d) The query contains one or more wrongly named clauses.

a) group by
b) group
c) group set
d) group attribute


Answer: a
Explanation: We apply the aggregate function to a group of sets of tuples using the group by clause. The group by clause must always be used whenever we are willing to apply the aggregate function to a group of sets of tuples.
5. Choose the correct option regarding the query

SELECT branch_name, COUNT (DISTINCT customer_name) 
FROM depositor, account 
WHERE depositor.account_number = account.account_number 
       GROUP BY branch_id
       HAVING avg(balance) = 10000;
a) The having clause checks whether the query result is true or not
b) The having clause does not check for any condition
c) The having clause allows only those tuples that have average balance 10000

Explanation: The having clause is used to check for conditions that need to be set on aggregate functions.
6. The _____ aggregation operation adds up all the values of the attribute
a) add
b) avg
c) max
d) sum


Answer: d
Explanation: The sum aggregation operation adds up all the values of the specified attribute. There does not exist any aggregation such as add.
7. State true or false: Any attribute which is present in the having clause without being aggregated must not be present in the group by clause.
a) True
b) False


Answer: b
Explanation: Any attribute which is present in the having clause without being aggregated must be present in the group by clause. Otherwise, the query is considered to be erroneous.
8. State true or false: We can rename the resulting attribute after the aggregation function has been applied
a) True
b) False


Answer: a
Explanation: Yes, we can rename the resulting attribute after the aggregation function has been applied by using a specific keyword.
9. Which keyword is used to rename the resulting attribute after the application of the aggregation function?
a) rename
b) as
c) replace
d) to


Answer: b
Explanation: The “as” keyword is used to rename the resulting attribute after the aggregation function has been applied. Just like any other renaming operation, the as keyword simplifies the name of the relation.
